This is a jquery plugin that enables the user to easily create maps in a DIV. It aims to be a replacement for OpenLayers. It's not ready yet, but some features work, see the demo page.

**jump** stands for jQuery unified map plugin. It was supposed to be called *simplified* map plugin, but jsmp didn't sound so good.
